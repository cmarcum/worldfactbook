# Demand Accountability. Restore the Data.

The sudden removal of the [World Factbook on February 4th, 2026](https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/spotlighting-the-world-factbook-as-we-bid-a-fond-farewell/) has left a void in global intelligence, education, and transparency. Providing rich, objective information and statistical data on all the nations of the world for decades, this resource belonged to the public and **you can help** to bring it back or build its successor.

### 1. Speak Truth to Power
The Administration needs to hear that the World Factbook is a critical tool for students, researchers, and policymakers alike. Demand a transparent explanation for its removal and a commitment to its restoration.

* **Write to Congress and the current Administration**.
* **The Message:** "The World Factbook is an essential public good. Its removal hinders global transparency and education. The Administration should provide a full explanation for its takedown and commit to the immediate restoration of public access its data."

* [Find and contact your Representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)
* [Contact your Senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/quo_list_menu.htm)
* [Members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence](https://intelligence.house.gov/hpsci-members/)
* [Members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/)
* [Message the White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/)

### 2. Spread the word
The World Factbook meant a lot to the public. If it meant something to you, whether you used it in grade school for a report or referenced it in your work, you can use your story to raise awareness about this takedown and spread the word through your networks.

* **Share this page:** Use the hashtag **#RestoreTheFactbook** on social media to spread the word.
* **Archive Awareness:** Encourage others to use [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org) or visit Simon Willison's [archive of the 2020 version](https://simonw.github.io/cia-world-factbook-2020) to access historical data while we fight for a live restoration.

### 3. A Call for Support
If the government will not host this incredible resource, the community must step-up to restore it. Data preservation initiatives that seek to save public resources like the World Factbook need support to be sustainable. Consider donating to the [DataRescueProject🛟](https://www.datarescueproject.org/), the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), or another such initiative. 

* **Commitment** To that end, this domain will be handed over to anyone interested in funding, developing, and maintaining an open-source full-stack restoration of the World Factbook.
